  <P>A recipe book, or receipt book, is a handwritten collection of recipes that are culinary,
   medical, domestic, and magical in nature. Most often written and maintained by women in the Early Modern era (1500-1750),
   theyâ€™re one of the first examples of the womenâ€™s medical writing genre.Create something memorable, unique, and fun. Give families a reason to gather around in the kitchen and work together.
   Give faraway friends a new experience to share over FaceTime.</P>
